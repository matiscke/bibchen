\maketitle{}

Are you writing a proposal with citations and you need a smaller reference
section? Tired of having to mess around with writing out each reference by hand
to make it small enough to fit? \texttt{bibchen} is here to help!

If we have some rather long text citing inline references:
\citet{Teague_ea_2018}, \citet{Teague_Foreman-Mackey_2018}, and
\citet{Teague_ea_2017}. Maybe there are some in parentheses
\citep{Teague_ea_2015, Teague_ea_2016}, but that's OK.

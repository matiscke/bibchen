\maketitle{}

Are you writing a propsal with citations and you need a smaller reference section? Tired of having to mess around with writing out each reference by hand to make it small enough to fit? \texttt{bibchen} is here to help!

If we have some rather long text citing \cite{Teague_ea_2018}, \cite{Teague_ea_2017}, \cite{Teague_ea_2016} and \citet{Teague_ea_2015} then we're good to go.

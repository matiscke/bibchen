\title{\texttt{bibchen} - Making Smaller Bibliographies}

\maketitle{}

Are you writing a proposal with citations and you need a smaller reference
section? Tired of having to mess around with writing out each reference by hand
to make it small enough to fit? \texttt{bibchen} is here to help!

If we have some rather long text citing inline references:
\citet{Cannon_Pickering_1918}, \citet{Rubin_ea_1980}, and
\citet{Leavitt_1908}. Maybe there are some in parentheses
\citep{Penzias_Wilson_1965, LIGO_2017}.
